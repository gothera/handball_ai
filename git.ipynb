    "Here's how to fix this:\n",

    "**Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token**\n",
    "1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)\n",
    "2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions\n",
    "3. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)\n",
    "4. When you run `git push --set-upstream origin main`, use the token as your password\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Use SSH instead of HTTPS** (recommended for long-term use)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, change your remote URL to use SSH:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gothera/handball_ai.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
